    Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space.

For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace.

      <h4>CAPSTONE</h4>
      <p>
        Professor Ellen went above and beyond to help me with this capstone project. She answered every email (sometimes multiples during the day) to respond to any questions or issues that I had. Her grading and notes were thorough and very helpful in providing me with feedback that allowed my writing to continue to excel throughout the capstone process. I couldn’t have asked for a better professor.

        Professor Ellen did an exceptional job of presenting, explaining, and reinforcing all the elements of the course. In particular, her responses to comments in the discussion board were always insightful as she asked further probing questions that always kick-started deeper thoughts. Her feedback on assignments (for example, journals and papers) were more detailed than I have experienced before, reinforcing that she read and valued every idea and provided suggestions for improvement and deeper reflection when needed. Her approach is one of grace and interest in every student’s contribution. Really an outstanding educator!

      Prof. Ellen was the whole enchilada – she is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Victorian Lit. She pushed us to go deeper into the material and squeeze as much as possible out of each module. She clearly spent a lot of time editing, evaluating, and commenting on our work. Her comments on my papers were targeted and her directions for changes were very helpful. Her edits were thorough and well-supported. She takes the topic very seriously and I respect her for her commitment.

      <h4>SEMINAR IN BRITISH LITERATURE</h4>
      <p>
        Professor Bluestone was very knowledgeable and ready to help with or further explain everything we did in class. Her comments on our blog posts were some of the most in depth I’ve gotten from any professor and I thought her response posts that asked questions about our blog posts were very helpful. I also found her comments on everything I turned in to be very insightful and again some of the longest and most in depth I’ve received. I don’t think there was anything I would want her to do differently.

      <h4>SEMINAR IN BRITISH LITERATURE</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Bluestone set the tone for excellence and she would not allow anything less. She knew what we were all capable of doing and she didn’t want us to ever be discouraged. Even on the toughest days as a student, she always encouraged me to reach out to her and talk it out with her on what I was lacking. She took what I had to offer, modified it and it evolved into a great life lesson. Things do take time, but also it is going into each assignment confident, not basing the grade before to determine it was going to be the same this time. I welcomed the challenges and I am lucky there are Professors like her that do not allow her students to ever fall into the dark holes and not be able to find a light to get back out. She’s the light.

                            Now is the winter of our discontent
                            Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
                            And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
                            In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
                            Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
                            Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
                            Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
                            Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
                            Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
                            And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
                            To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
                            He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
                            To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
                            But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
                            Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
                            I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
                            To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
                            I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
                            Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
                            Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
                            Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
                            And that so lamely and unfashionable
                            That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
                            Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
                            Have no delight to pass away the time,
                            Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
                            And descant on mine own deformity:
                            And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
                            To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
                            I am determined to prove a villain
                            And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
                            Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
                            By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
                            To set my brother Clarence and the king
                            In deadly hate the one against the other:
                            And if King Edward be as true and just
                            As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
                            This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
                            About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
                            Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
                            Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
                            Clarence comes.
